  <h3 class="text">Introduction of the Community</h3>
  <p class="text">Our partner institution, SAKADAB, is a community consisting of 27 people with disabilities. On the road to their goal<br> of independence, everyone and their families have worked and collaborated together to maintain their businesses <br>such as bakeries, sewing shops and boutiques; where  they make various products, ranging from trinkets and accessories <br>to bakery pastries such as hot pandesal and kalihim. SAKADAB's community resides in a village designed and constructed by <br>volunteers, located in Barangay Los Amigos, Tugbok. They aim to prove that disability is no excuse to be living unfulfillingly.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h3 class="text">Mission</h3>
  <p class="text">SAKADAB has existed for people who are in crisis specifically for PWDs and despite the obstacles experienced <br>they didn’t let that stop them from doing what they love, but instead they’ve utilized their talents given by God.<br> The members of the organization used their skills to gain financially to help themselves and the institution. Their goal is to<br> increase the quality of living and become self-reliant. They do not have specific programs or services that they can offer<br> but they do provide each other spiritual, moral and financial support to live a life, they were able to have a Kairos despite the crisis.</p>
  <br>
