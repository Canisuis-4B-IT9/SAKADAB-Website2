    <h1 class="text">BACKGROUND</h1>
    <h3 class="text">Offerings</h3>
    <p class="text">We are offering a fundraiser/donation campaign conducted both online and in real life. Not only does this project gather finances from those who are willing <br>to give it, we also encourage donation of clothes, toys/gadgets and other products. Along with this, we will also take on the responsibility of creating posters<br> and posting them on popular social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook in order to garner more attention towards the organization. In addition to<br> all these proposals, we have created this website to contain all the information you need to know about our projects, about us, and about our beloved partner institution.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3 class="text">Importance of the project</h3>
    <p class="text">This project is not only important to the Institution, but for us and the community. As they are a non-profit Institution, they need help getting enough funds<br> for their healthcare, education, and other consumables. Which is why we started this project. As the Institution continues to seek help due to their situation,<br> we have the opportunity to do better. Through this project, we have the ability to show others what they can do to help. And even you can help too. We want<br> to spread our influence and show others what they can do. To not only help SAKADAB but to help others as well. This project can inspire, help, and encourage others<br> to do the right thing. Which is why we need everyone's cooperation!</p>
    <br>

    <h3 class="text">Hearts for SAKADAB Campaign Mission</h3>
    <p class="text">The HFS Campaign (Heart’s for Sakadab Campaign) is here and present for SAKADAB (Samahan ng may iba't ibang Kakayahan sa Dabaw). The Campaign <br>aspires to truly be Men and Women for others. They plan on achieving this by using their skills and talents for the better good. Despite their youth, they are <br>certain that their help will assist the Institution especially during the crisis they are in as of the moment. As the Campaign continues in the help of the cause<br> for the Institution, they believe that they can be of service to SAKADAB.</p>
